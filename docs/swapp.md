The Laboratory for Software Analytics and Pervasive Parallelism led by Dr. Ali Jannesari in the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. Our mission is to advance the state of the art in building reliable and efficient software, and utilize various analytical and computing technologies to improve the quality of software and the development productivity. In particular, we focus on methods, techniques and tools for software engineering and parallel computing. Our results and research findings help application developers to utilize the modern hardware platforms and develop complex software systems of in-demand areas such as deep learning (data science), embedded and mobile computing, and high-performance computing (HPC).
